# Project 1: Performative Pop Shop
CS 151 | Fall 2025 | Telvin Zhong

#### Abstract
You wake up in a cold sweat. Not from a nightmare, but from the gnawing realization that your aesthetic isn't <i>giving</i> anymore. Your Miffy keychain isn't impressing anyone (tragic), your mom's Canon has dust on the lens (inauthentic), and your matcha supply ran out two days ago (criminal).

It's time. You must embark on your sacred pilgrimage. You must goâ€¦ to the <b>Performative Pop Shop!!!</b>.

This is your temple. The walls are plastered with ironic posters of 2000s cartoons and vintage anime no one actually watched. The air smells like incense and expensive soy. A barista wearing wired headphones pours you a <b>Matcha</b> that tastes like validation. You pick up a <b>Labubu</b> that's weird enough to match your curated detachment. You snag a disposable <b>Digicam</b> for posting blurry flash selfies on your close friends story.

You leave the Performative Pop Shop with a tote bag full of aura. The world may never understand you, but at least your Instagram followers will.
